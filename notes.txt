plan:

model curve of growth rate
is that modeling growth rate?
i'm thinking it's an exp()

how many pts have weird profiles again?
how many pts are funded right away?
	can we predict these?

k-means clustering to determine how many groups of pts there are, in terms of how quickly they get funded?

then, model when the first donation will be
does it have sth to do w whether it was posted at night? like, ppl don't check until like 9a?

what attributes of a proj/pt make it more likely to be funded quickly?



clustering for hours-to-fund (hours-to-fund by target_amt?)


maybe do k means on hours-to-fund/target amt? hard time finding my code to make cost curve...


when doing K-means, i cld get 3 or 4 grps. wht is the 4th grp? those points that don't fit well into either of the 3 models? the 'step-wise' model?
if i cld visualize K-means in 3D, i cld show this...
